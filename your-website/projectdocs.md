I'd like your help creating a modern, professional personal website that positions me as an AI Scientist/Researcher focused on the intersection of AI and social impact. I'll be hosting this online under my own domain.

Please help me design and implement a website with:

- A modern tech stack (suggest frameworks/tools that would work well)

- Clean, professional design

- Responsive layout

- Main sections including:

  - Homepage introducing my focus on AI for social good

  - Projects page showcasing my technical work

  - Blog/Thoughts section for AI ethics and social impact writing

  - About page with my background and vision

  - Contact information

My background includes computer science, interest in AI's societal impact, and experience with challenging coursework like Data Structures & Algorithms. I want to emphasize my interest in using AI to enhance human potential and improve access to education and opportunities.

Please help me plan this out step by step, starting with:

1. Recommended tech stack and frameworks

2. Site structure and navigation

3. Content organization

4. Key design elements and features

5. Sample content for each section

Can you help me begin building this website with detailed code examples and guidance?
