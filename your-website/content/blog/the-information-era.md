# The Information Era 

What if I told you that you possess a power that would have been considered godlike just a century ago? That in your pocket right now sits a device that grants you access to more knowledge than was contained in all the world's greatest libraries combined?

You'd probably nod and think, "Yes, smartphones are amazing," before checking your notifications and moving on with your day.

And therein lies an interesting paradox of modern life.

## The Wonder That Disappeared

I was recently reflecting on how quickly we've normalized what might be the most radical transformation in human history: our virtually unlimited access to information.

Consider for a moment what it meant to be curious about something in 1980. A question might send you to a library, possibly requiring a long drive. If the local library didn't have what you needed, you might wait weeks for an inter-library loan. Some questions simply remained unanswered, floating in that vast space of the unknown that once dominated human experience.

Today, that space has shrunk dramatically. Curious about how hummingbirds sleep? The average rainfall in Bhutan? The definition of a quantum harmonic oscillator? The answers materialize before us in seconds.

Yet we rarely pause to marvel at this reality.

## Through Einstein's Eyes

Imagine Albert Einstein transported to our time. Picture him discovering that he could instantly access any scientific paper ever published, watch lectures from the world's leading physicists, or communicate his ideas to colleagues across the globe in real-time.

Would he take this for granted as we do? Or would he approach this power with the wonderment and intention it deserves?

This thought experiment helps me see our information environment with fresh eyes. The question shifts from "What do I have?" to "How would someone who truly appreciated this power use it?"

## The Grand Canyon Effect

Our adaptation to the extraordinary is understandable. Just as someone living beside the Grand Canyon might eventually register it simply as "the view," we've normalized what previous generations would have considered miraculous. It took over 5 million years to create such a marvel, but humans are only capable of looking at this wonder at face-value. 

This isn't a failure of gratitude but a feature of human perception. We're remarkably good at adapting to our environments, at making the extraordinary ordinary through exposure. This adaptation has evolutionary advantages—it allows us to notice changes and anomalies rather than being perpetually overwhelmed by the familiar.

But sometimes, this very adaptation causes us to lose sight of the wonder surrounding us.

## Rekindling the Wonder

So how might we recapture some of that wonder without fighting against our nature?

Perhaps it starts with momentary awareness—brief recognitions of what we're actually doing when we casually look up an answer, watch a tutorial, or connect with a community of like-minded people across the world.

Perhaps it means occasionally adopting the perspective of someone from the past—or someone from a part of the world where this access remains limited—and seeing our tools through their eyes.

Or maybe it means channeling that Einsteinian curiosity more intentionally, approaching our vast information access not as consumers but as explorers and creators.

## Beyond Appreciation

This isn't about feeling obligated to appreciate technology. It's about recognizing that seeing the true significance of what we have might change how we use it.

When we truly grasp the magnitude of our information access, we might approach it less casually and more purposefully. We might ask better questions, pursue deeper understanding, and use this extraordinary power to address the challenges we face rather than simply to entertain ourselves between moments of boredom.

The miracle isn't just that we have this access—it's that we have the opportunity to use it in ways previous generations could only dream of.
